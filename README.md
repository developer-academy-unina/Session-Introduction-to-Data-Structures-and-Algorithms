## About

The project simulates a queue of kitchen orders. On the main screen you can see all the orders that were placed and by tapping on the "Prepare Next Order" button, the order on the top of the queue is popped.

You can add a new order by tapping on the New Order button located on the Navigation Bar and filling the new order form.

The project has the goal of demonstrating the usage of the swift-collections package. The data structure being used in the project is the Dequeue, to simulate the queue of orders that the kitchen must prepare.
